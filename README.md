## Overview
### Project goal
Rewrite the abandonware Boulder Dash created in 1984 by Peter Liepa and Chris Gray.
The goal of the game is to collect enough diamonds (12 here) to unlock the exit door and then reach that door to win. In order to do this, the player must dig his way while avoiding boulders and monsters.

### Repo Content
